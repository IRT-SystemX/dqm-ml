"""
Main Module for Data Completeness Evaluation

This script utilizes the DataCompleteness class from the metric module to assess
the completeness of data in a DataFrame. It calculates and prints the overall
completeness score of the data as well as the completeness score for a specific
column in the DataFrame. This script is particularly useful for preliminary data
analysis in data cleaning and preprocessing stages.

Usage:
    Run this script directly after ensuring the metric.py module is available
    in the same directory or Python path. The script reads a specified CSV file
    and evaluates its data completeness.
